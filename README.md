# Sensor_Network_Gossip_Push-Sum-
Simulation of Various Sensor Network Topologies with Gossip and Push-Sum Algorithm.
Topologies Included: Linear Network, 2D Mesh, 3D Cube of nodes, imperfect 3D Cube of Nodes.
Name:   Mayank K Dadheech



How to Run:

Main project
1. using terminal prompt go to directory MayankProject2/project2/
2. type command  “sbt”  and press enter
3. type command  “run 24 full gossip” and enter. Change the values in input as per your convenience

Bonus Project:
1. use terminal to go to directory /MayankProject2/project2_Bonus/
2. type command  “sbt”  and press enter
3. type command  “run 24 full gossip” and enter. Change the values in input as per your convenience
4. The values for number of node failures is set in the code and can be changes by changing variable “failure” at lines 57 and 763 in the source code file.
